## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer who loves building stuff. My primary interests are web applications and enterprise-level systems. My expertise is in JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, with developing proficiencies in C/C++, Java, and Golang (Go).

DISCLAIMER: All projects are purely educational, aimed at practicing various programming languages and concepts in real-world scenarios. They were not intended to be fully-fledged, ready-for-production applications.
